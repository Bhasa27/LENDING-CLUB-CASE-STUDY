## General Information
Background:

Consumer finance companies face challenges in balancing business growth with minimizing financial risk. Approving loans for likely defaulters leads to financial losses, while rejecting trustworthy applicants results in business loss. Risk analytics helps analyse historical data to predict defaults, enabling informed lending decisions and improved financial outcomes

Business Objective:

The primary goal of this case study is to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors that influence loan defaults that can help the company to take better decision

Dataset Used : 

We have used loan.csv which was provided by Upgrad team

## Conclusions
- Loan Amount: Risk increases with smaller loan amounts
- Loan Term: Long-term loans are riskier; shorter terms are preferable
- Interest Rate: 10%-18% range requires stricter monitoring
- Annual Income: Borrowers in $36,500–$73,000 should be scrutinized more
- Employment Details: Evaluate both tenure and stability; 1–3 years and 10+ years are risky
- Housing Status: Renters and those with mortgages default more
- Loan Purpose: Debt consolidation, small businesses, and credit card loans need rigorous checks
- Verification Status: Verification should go beyond income validation
- Credit Utilization: High utilization (>30%) combined with low revolving balances is risky
- Revolving Balance: Low balances suggest financial instability 
- Grade : high-risk grades like F and G should have stricter lending conditions should be applied
